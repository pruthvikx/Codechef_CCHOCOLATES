Test case 22: Chef has 3 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 10 = 253⋅5+1⋅10=25 rupees in total. Since each chocolate costs 88 rupees, Chef can buy a maximum of 33 chocolates for Chefina, leaving him with 11 rupee.

Test case 33: Chef has 8 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 10 = 508⋅5+1⋅10=50 rupees in total. Since each chocolate costs 33 rupees, Chef can buy a maximum of 1616 chocolates for Chefina, leaving him with 22 rupee.

Test case 44: Chef has 4 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 10 = 604⋅5+4⋅10=60 rupees in total. Since each chocolate costs 10001000 rupees, Chef can buy no chocolate for Chefina, leaving him with 6060 rupees.
